# TamperTube

### Purpose and Methodology
- Attempt to improve aspects of YouTube that I find interfere with optimal usage.
- Buttons will be bare bones and located on the page in places that may not be flattering because TamperMonkey (which I am using to run the scripts) runs right away regardless of YouTube's lazy loading which may otherwise "delete" dom elements added to the page within menus.
- Styles are added in the Stylish chrome extension. These are largely just classes that I refer to in the code.


### Functionalities
1. Hide miniplayer without closing miniplayer so that:
    - you can prevent it from blocking your visual real estate when checking the homepage for videos
    - you can listen without seeing the miniplayer
2. Switch the positions of the comment section and the suggested videos sections so that you can read the comments next to the video
3. Have the miniplayer appear after you scroll past the video on the page like it would on BiliBili and other video platforms so that you can still see the video as you scroll down the page
